Threads are light-weight processes within a process. They share with other threads their code section, data section and OS resources like open files and signals.

# Thread Concept üí°

Thread and process are similar concepts in operating systems. But, they are different in the following ways:

**Process:** 

- An instance of a program that is being executed.¬†
- Need to make a separate system call `fork()` for each creation of a process to the OS.
- Exists within its own address or memory space.
- Independent and treated as an isolated process by the OS.

**Thread:**

- A unit of execution (single sequence stream) within a process. It is a light-weight process.
- Shares with other threads their code section, data section and OS resources like open files and signals.
- Has its own program counter (PC), a register set, and a stack space.¬†
- Be able to be scheduled by the operating system and run as independent entities within a process.
- A process can have multiple threads.

The table below shows the characteristics of both process and thread: üìë

| Characteristic        | Process                                                                                                             | Thread                                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**        | An instance of a running program.                                                                                   | An execution path within a process.                                                                              |
| **Resources**         | Has its own separate memory space, file descriptors, etc.                                                           | Shares the resources (e.g., memory) of the parent process, but has its own stack, registers, etc.                |
| **Isolation**         | Highly isolated; a crash in one process typically does not affect others.                                           | Less isolated within the same process; a thread crash can cause the entire process to crash.                     |
| **Communication**     | Inter-Process Communication (IPC) is more complex, requiring special mechanisms (pipes, message queues, etc.).      | Intra-process communication is simpler, as threads can directly access shared data.                              |
| **Creation Overhead** | Creating a process is more expensive, as the OS needs to allocate new address spaces and other resources.           | Creating a thread is less expensive, as it does not need to duplicate most of the parent process's resources.    |
| **Context Switching** | Context switching costs are higher, involving saving and restoring more state information.                          | Context switching costs are lower, as only a smaller amount of state information needs to be saved and restored. |
| **Scheduling**        | Scheduled by the operating system scheduler.                                                                        | Can be scheduled by either the operating system or user-level libraries.                                         |
| **Multitasking**      | On a single-core CPU, processes appear to run concurrently over time. On multi-core CPUs, they can run in parallel. | More suitable for lightweight parallel or concurrent tasks within the same application.                          |
| **Usage**             | Suitable for running completely independent applications.                                                           | Suitable for task decomposition within the same application to improve responsiveness and resource utilization.  |

# Operation on Threads üìù

For coding with multiple threads, it is unlike Java, multithreading is not supported by C language standard. `POSIX Threads` is a POSIX standard for threads and its implementation is provided by the `pthread` library.

<font color="red">Tips: when compiling, the `pthread` in gcc/g++, add option `-lpthread` for linking. </font>

## Thread Creation

To create a thread, we can use the following function:

```cpp
int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr, void *(*start_routine) (void *), void *arg);
```

Parameters:
- `thread`: Pointer to an integer that will store the ID of the created thread.
- `attr`: Thread attributes. It can be `NULL` if not used. We can specify `PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE` if we want to join the thread after it is created.
- `start_routine`: The function that will be executed by the thread. It is a pointer to the function that will be executed by the thread.
- `arg`: The argument that will be passed to the function.

Return value:
- `0` if the thread is created successfully. Otherwise, it returns an error code.
- `EINVAL` if the `start_routine` is `NULL`.
- `EAGAIN` if the maximum number of threads has been reached.
- `ENOMEM` if there is not enough memory to create the thread.
- `EDEADLK` if the thread is already created.

## Thread Termination

To terminate a thread, use the following function:

```cpp
void pthread_exit (void *value_ptr);
```

Parameters:
- `value_ptr`: The value that will be returned by the thread when it is terminated. (`NULL` if not used.)

Additional notes:
- This function is used to explicitly exit a thread. Typically, the `pthread_exit()` function is called after a thread has completed its work.
- If `main()` finishes before the threads it has created, and exits with `pthread_exit()`, the other threads will continue to execute. Otherwise, they will be automatically terminated when `main()` finishes.
- Use `pthread_exit()` to exit from all threads, especially `main()`.

## Thread Synchronization

Joining a thread is a blocking operation, which means that the thread will wait for the other thread to finish. We can use the following function:

```cpp
int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void *retval);
```

Parameters:
- `thread`: The ID of the thread that will be joined.
- `retval`: The value that will be returned by the joined thread. (`NULL` if not used.)
  
Return value:
- `0` if the thread is joined successfully. Otherwise, it returns an error code.
- otherwise, it returns an error code.

Additional notes:
- It is impossible to join a detached thread.
-   When a thread is created, one of its attributes defines whether it is joinable or detached. Detached means it can never be joined. (`PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED` or `PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE`)

## Thread Mutex

Mutex (mutual exclusion) is a synchronization mechanism that allows only one thread to access a resource at a time. It is used to protect shared data from concurrent access. It is used to implement a lock mechanism:

{% include image_caption.html imageurl="/images/thread-mutex.png" title=" Thread Mutex" caption="Thread Mutex"%}

Mutex should be declared as follows, where `mutex` is the name of the mutex.
```cpp
pthread_mutex_t mutex;
```


Mutex should be initialized before it is used:
```cpp
int pthread_mutex_init(pthread_mutex_t *mutex, const pthread_mutexattr_t *mutexattr);
```
- `mutex`: Pointer to an integer that will store the mutex ID.
- `mutexattr`: Mutex attributes. It can be `NULL` to use the default.


Mutex should be destroyed after it is used:
```cpp
int pthread_mutex_destroy(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
```
- `mutex`: Pointer to an integer that stores the mutex ID.


To acquire a lock on the specified mutex variable:
```cpp
int pthread_mutex_lock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
```
- If the mutex is successfully locked, it returns `0`. Otherwise, it returns an error code.
- If the mutex is already locked by another thread, this will block until the mutex is unlocked.


To attempt to acquire a lock on the specified mutex variable:
```cpp
int pthread_mutex_trylock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
```
- If the mutex is successfully locked, it returns `0`. Otherwise, it returns an error code.
- If the mutex is already locked by another thread, it returns error.
- Useful in preventing deadlocks.


To release a lock on the specified mutex variable:
```cpp
int pthread_mutex_unlock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
```
- If the mutex is successfully unlocked, it returns `0`. Otherwise, it returns an error code. For example:
  - The Mutex was already unlocked.
  - The Mutex was owned by another thread.
