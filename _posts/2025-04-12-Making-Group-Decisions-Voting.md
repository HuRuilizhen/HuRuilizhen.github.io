In the previous post, we examined how agents make decisions in two-agent games, focusing on the **Nash Equilibrium**. In this post, we will explore how a group of agents make decisions, delving into the realm of social choice theory. A classic example of social choice theory is **voting**, where the challenge is to combine individual preferences to derive a social outcome. This post discusses voting mechanism in group decision making in Lecture 10 of the `SC4003` course in NTU. Let's begin!

# Notations and Definitions

Notation system make life easier when we are talking about something like voting. Let's have a short definition of game theory notations, which will make the rest of this post easier to understand.

## Components of a Social Choice Model

The set of voters (a.k.a agents in the context of the course) is defined as:

$$
    Ag = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}
$$

Voters make group decisions with respect to a set of "outcomes" or "candidates":

$$
    \Omega = \{\omega_1, \omega_2, ... \omega_3\}
$$

If $\| \Omega \| = 2$, say we have a pairwise election.

## Preferences

Each voter has preferences over $\Omega$. It is an **ordering** over the set of possible outcomes $\Omega$. Take following wines as the example:

$$
    \Omega = \{ \text{gin}, \text{rum}, \text{brandy}, \text{whisky}\}
$$

The preference of agent $ray$ is denoted as:

$$
    \bar{\omega}_{ray} = \langle \text{whisky}, \text{rum}, \text{gin}, \text{brandy} \rangle
$$

which means that agent $ray$ prefers whisky to rum, rum to gin, gin to brandy, and brandy to whisky. These can also be written as:

$$
    \text{whisky} \succ_{ray} \text{rum} \succ_{ray} \text{gin} \succ_{ray} \text{brandy}
$$

The fundamental problem of **social choice theory** is to determine **how to aggregate individual preference orders** of voters into a collective decision that accurately represents the preferences of the group. This involves understanding how to merge diverse individual preferences into a coherent group preference. There are two primary approaches to preference aggregation: **social welfare functions**, which focus on ranking social states based on individual preferences, and **social choice functions**, which aim to select a single outcome from a set of alternatives.

## Social Welfare Functions

The set of preference orderings over $\Omega$ is denoted as:

$$
    \pi(\Omega)
$$

A social welfare function $f$ takes the **voter preferences order** and produces a **social preference order**, e.g. beauty contest:

$$
f: \pi(\Omega) \times \pi(\Omega) \times \ldots \times \pi(\Omega) \rightarrow \pi(\Omega)
$$

To denote the **outcome comparison** of a social welfare function:

$$
    \succ^*
$$

Sometimes, we want to select one of the possible candidates, rather than a social order. This gives social choice functions $f$, e.g. presidential election:

$$
f: \pi(\Omega) \times \pi(\Omega) \times \ldots \times \pi(\Omega) \rightarrow \Omega
$$

# Voting Procedures: Plurality

**Social Choice Function**, which selects a single outcome according to all **preferences** of the voters. Each candidate gets one point for every **preference order** that ranks them **first**. The **winner** is the one with the **largest number of points**. For example, **Political elections in UK**. If we have only two candidates, then **plurality** is a simple **majority election**.

## Anomalies with Plurality

One anomaly with the plurality voting procedure is that it can produce a winner that is **not supported by a majority of voters**. For example, consider an election with $100$ voters and three candidates $\omega_1$, $\omega_2$, and $\omega_3$ where the distribution of votes is as follows:
- $40%$ of voters vote for $\omega_1$
- $30%$ of voters vote for $\omega_2$
- $30%$ of voters vote for $\omega_3$

In this scenario, Ï‰1 would win the election with $40\%$ of the votes, even though a clear majority ($60\%$) of the voters prefer another candidate. This is a limitation of the plurality voting procedure in that it does not ensure that the winner is supported by a majority of the voters.

## Strategic Manipulation by Tactical Voting

The concept of strategic manipulation by tactical voting is a phenomenon where a voter may vote for a candidate other than their true preference in order to achieve a better outcome. This can occur when a voter believes that their true preference is not viable, and that by voting for a second choice, they can prevent a less desirable candidate from winning. This is also known as **strategic voting** or **insincere voting**. For example, if a voter's true preference is candidate $A$, but they believe that candidate $B$ is more likely to win than $A$, they may vote for $B$ in order to prevent candidate $C$ from winning, even if $B$ is not their true preference.

$$
    \text{Strategic voting: } \text{Vote for } B \text{ to prevent } C \text{ from winning}
$$

In this scenario, the voter is engaging in strategic manipulation of the vote, as they are not voting for their true preference. This can lead to a situation where the outcome of the election does not accurately reflect the true preferences of the voters. Let's take a look at following example, suppose my preferences are:

$$
    \omega_1 \succ \omega_2 \succ \omega_3
$$

I believe $48.9\%$ of voters have preferences:

$$
    \omega_2 \succ \omega_1 \succ \omega_3
$$

and I believe $49.1\%$ of voters have preferences

$$
    \omega_3 \succ \omega_2 \succ \omega_1
$$

Then if I can represent $2\%$ of voters, I may do better voting for $\omega_2$ , even though this is not my true preference profile.

## Condorcet's Paradox

Condorcet's paradox arises in voting scenarios where a **majority preference cycle** exists. Given a set of agents $Ag = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and outcomes $\Omega = \{\omega_1, \omega_2, \omega_3\}$, consider the preferences:

$$
\begin{align*}
  \omega_1 & \succ_1 \omega_2 \succ_1 \omega_3 \\
  \omega_3 & \succ_2 \omega_1 \succ_2 \omega_2 \\
  \omega_2 & \succ_3 \omega_3 \succ_3 \omega_1
\end{align*}
$$

In this setup, for any candidate chosen, there exists another candidate preferred by a majority, leading to no clear winner. This exemplifies Condorcet's paradox, where no option satisfies the majority.

# Sequential Majority Elections

A variant of plurality, in which players play in a series of rounds: either a linear sequence or a tree (knockout tournament). We can use an example to understand this:

{% include image_caption.html imageurl="/images/sequential-pairwise-election.png" title="Sequential Majority Elections" caption="sequential majority elections" %}

## Anomalies with Sequential Pairwise Elections

Here, we pick an ordering of the outcomes,which determines who plays against who.For example, if the agenda is:

$$
\langle \omega_2, \omega_3, \omega_4, \omega_1 \rangle
$$

Then the first election is between $\omega_2$ and $\omega_3$ , and the winner goes on to an election with \omega_4, and the winner of this election goes in an election with $\omega_1$. Anomalies can occur in sequential pairwise elections because the winner of an election may not be supported by a majority of the voters but depend on the **agenda**. Suppose we have:

$$
    \begin{align*}
        \text{33 voters prefer } & \omega_1 \succ \omega_2 \succ \omega_3 \\
        \text{33 voters prefer } & \omega_3 \succ \omega_1 \succ \omega_2 \\
        \text{33 voters prefer } & \omega_2 \succ \omega_3 \succ \omega_1
  \end{align*}
$$

Then for every candidate, we can fix an agenda for that candidate to win in a sequential pairwise election! This can be demonstrated better using a **majority graph**.

## Majority Graphs

This idea is easiest to illustrate by using a majority graph, which is a directed graph with:
- vertices represent candidates
- an edge $(i, j)$ if $i$ would beat $j$ is a **simple majority election**.

It is a compact representation of voter preferences. Let's take a look at an example:

{% include image_caption.html imageurl="/images/majority-graph.png" title="Majority Graph" caption="majority graph" %}

A Condorcet winner is a candidate that would beat every other candidate in a pairwise election. Like:

# Voting Procedures: Borda Count

The Borda count is a voting procedure that **takes into account the whole preference order of each voter**, unlike the plurality voting procedure which only considers the top ranked candidate. In the Borda count, each candidate is **assigned a score based on its position in each voter's preference order**. The score is calculated as follows: if a candidate appears first in a preference order, its score is incremented by $k-1$, where k is the number of candidates; if it appears second, its score is incremented by $k-2$, and so on, until the last candidate in the preference order has its score incremented by $0$. After all voters have been considered, the candidate with the highest score is declared the winner. This procedure is **more representative of the voters' true preferences** than the plurality procedure, as it takes into account the strength of opinion in favour of each candidate.

## Desirable Properties of Voting Procedures

A desirable voting procedure should satisfy two fundamental properties: the **Pareto property** and **Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA)**. 

- The **Pareto property** states that if all voters prefer candidate $\omega_i$ over candidate $\omega_j$, then the social choice should also rank $\omega_i$ higher than $\omega_j$. This is a basic requirement that the **social choice should respect the unanimous preference of the voters**.

- The **IIA property** states that the **relative ranking of candidates** $\omega_i$ and $\omega_j$ should only **depend on the relative ranking** of $\omega_i$ and $\omega_j$ in **each voter's preference order**, and should not be affected by the **introduction or removal of "irrelevant" alternatives**. This property ensures that the social choice is focused on the true relative preferences of the voters, and is not influenced by external factors.

In summary, a desirable voting procedure should satisfy the **Pareto property and the IIA property**, which are two fundamental requirements for a fair and reasonable social choice.

## Arrow's Theorem

This theorem, proposed by economist Kenneth Arrow in 1951, reveals the fundamental impossibility of designing a fair and democratic voting system. The theorem states that:

In a situation with **three or more candidates**, any voting system that satisfies the **Pareto property** and the **IIA property**, must be a **dictatorship**, meaning that the final social ranking is determined by a single individual's personal preference, without considering the opinions of others.

We initially hoped to design a fair and democratic voting system that respects the preferences of all individuals and is not influenced by irrelevant alternatives.

Arrow's theorem proves that such a system is technically impossible, unless we allow a single individual to determine the outcome (i.e., a dictatorship).

## The Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem

We already saw that sometimes, voters can benefit by s**trategically misrepresenting their preferences**. Are there any voting methods which are non-manipulable, in the sense that voters can never benefit from misrepresenting preferences? The answer is given by the **Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem**ï¼š

> In votes with three or more candidates, if a voting system is deterministic, non-authoritarian, and always produces a winner, then the system can be strategically manipulated.

which means no reasonable voting system can completely prevent voters from changing the outcome through dishonest voting. However, a news is that **Computational Complexity can Help Rescue**! 

Bartholdi, Tovey, and Trick showed that there are elections that are prone to manipulation in principle, but where manipulation was computationally complex."Single Transferable Vote" is a voting method that is NP-hard to manipulate!
