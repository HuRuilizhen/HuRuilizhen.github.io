Coalitional games are a type of game theoretical model that study scenarios where agents can reap mutual benefits from cooperation. In such games, a coalition is a group of agents that work together and obtain a payoff for their collective effort. The agents are considered "cooperative" since cooperation yields them more payoffs than non-cooperation. This post discusses on coalition in Lecture 11 in the `SC4003` course in NTU. See details below!
