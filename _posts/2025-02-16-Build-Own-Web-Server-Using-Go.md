In our team, March Studio, we developed a scheduling module that requires concurrency capabilities. Initially, we built this module using Python with the Flask library, but we encountered performance issues. As a result, we decided to create a simple web server using Golang. This module is still under development. This article documents my experience building a web server with Golang, and I hope it can be helpful to others.

# What is Golang, Why Use It, and How to Start Using It?

## Introduction to Golang

**Go**, also known as **Golang**, is a **statically typed**, **compiled**, and **concurrent-friendly** programming language developed by Google. It aims to address the **pain points of C++** in large-scale software development, such as slow compilation speed, high code complexity, and difficulty in managing concurrent programming. **Go inherits the efficiency of C while simplifying its syntax**, making it easier to write and maintain.

Go has the following notable features:
- **Statically Typed**: Go is statically typed, which means that the type system checks the types of variables at compile time and prevents type errors.
- **Automatic Garbage Collection**: Go provides automatic garbage collection, which frees the developer from worrying about memory management.
- **Single Binary File Compilation**: Go compiles directly into machine code, generating a **stand-alone executable file** without additional dependencies, which makes deployment more convenient.
- **Rich Standard Library**: Go provides a rich standard library that includes **HTTP server**, **JSON parsing**, **database access**, and more, reducing the need for third-party libraries.
- **Built-in Concurrency**: Go natively supports concurrent programming through lightweight threads (**goroutine**) and channels, enabling efficient concurrent processing.

> A goroutine is a **lightweight thread** in the Go programming language. Each goroutine only occupies a **few KB** of memory, while an OS thread usually takes up several MB. Therefore, Go servers can efficiently handle large-scale concurrent requests. For more information, see the [Wikipedia Page on Concurrency in Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)#Concurrency).

Go is becoming the top choice for web development due to its high performance, simplicity, and maintainability. Go's statically compiled, compiled to a single binary file, has a strong standard library, built-in dependency management, supports cross-compilation, and has a concurrency model that is highly efficient. We can write a simple web server through following code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, Golang Web Server!")
}

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

Although Go's standard library is already powerful, the community has also developed many excellent web frameworks to make development more efficient:
- **[Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/)**: A high-performance web framework that provides features such as routing, middleware, and JSON parsing, making it easier to use than `net/http`.
- **[Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/)**: Similar to Gin, but with better performance, suitable for building RESTful APIs.
- **[Fiber](https://gofiber.io/)**: Based on the fasthttp library, designed for high-performance web servers, suitable for extreme high-concurrency scenarios.
