# 👋 Hello, I'm Ruilizhen HU! You can also call me Ray! 🚀

A soon-to-be Computer Science graduate from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, about to embark on a new journey as a software engineer at a leading internet company 🐧 in mainland China. I'm passionate about machine learning, algorithms, and full-stack development. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, reading manga, playing video games, and exploring new technologies and trends. Always eager to learn and explore more, I'm excited to see what the future holds! The figure above is a picture of me (with my girlfriend) in the past.
