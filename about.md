I’m a software engineer based in Shenzhen, China, with a background in
computer science. My work and interests center around building reliable,
maintainable software systems, with particular attention to correctness
and practical engineering trade-offs.

My current focus includes:

- General software engineering with an emphasis on clean design and maintainability
- Systems-related topics such as concurrency fundamentals and performance considerations
- Small tools and experimental components built to better understand system behavior

This website serves as a long-term record of my technical work and notes, including
engineering write-ups, experiments, and selected study or research materials. Most
content is written to clarify problems encountered in practice rather than as
polished tutorials.

Outside of work, I enjoy traveling and reading.
